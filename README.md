Inspired by the day picker in the builtin Android clock app.

**Note:** I'm not actively working on new features for this library. I'm only addressing critical bugs. With that being said contributions for new features are more than welcome and I am available to review pull requests. See [contributing.md](https://github.com/gantonious/MaterialDayPicker/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in contributing.

### Changes from 0.7.2

### Changes from 0.7.1

**Bug fixes**
- Fixes an issue where calling `setSelectedDays` would cause selected days to flash off and on.

### Changes from 0.7.0

**Configuration Improvements**
- You can now enable/disable days from being selected using enableDay/disableDay methods. See more below.
- You can now set the selection mode via xml by using the `app:selectionMode` attribute.

Download the latest version by adding the following to your project's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'ca.antonious:materialdaypicker:0.7.4'
}
```

## Using MaterialDayPicker in your App

You can just drop the view into your existing xml:

```xml
<ca.antonious.materialdaypicker.MaterialDayPicker
    android:id="@+id/day_picker"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
```

You can get the currently selected days by using:

```kotlin
val selectedDays = materialDayPicker.selectedDays
// returns [MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.TUESDAY, MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.FRIDAY]
```

You can set the selected days by doing:

```kotlin
val daysToSelect = listOf(MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.TUESDAY, MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.FRIDAY)
materialDayPicker.setSelectedDays(daysToSelect)
```

If you want to only allow one day to be selected at a time you can do:

```kotlin
materialDayPicker.selectionMode = SingleSelectionMode.create()
```

This can also be set via xml using the `selectionMode` attribute:

```xml
<ca.antonious.materialdaypicker.MaterialDayPicker
    ...
    app:selectionMode="ca.antonious.materialdaypicker.SingleSelectionMode"/>
```

You can enable/disable days using the following methods. Note if you disable a day when it's selected it cannot be deselected:

```kotlin
materialDayPicker.enableDay(MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.Monday)
materialDayPicker.disableDay(MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.Monday)
materialDayPicker.setDayEnable(MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.Monday, isEnabled = false)
```

If you want to listen to whenever the day selection is changed you can use:

```kotlin
materialDayPicker.setDaySelectionChangedListener { selectedDays ->
    // handle selection change
}
```

If you need to know when a specific day is selected/deselected you can use:


```kotlin
materialDayPicker.setDayPressedListener { weekday, isSelected ->
    // handle weekday selection
}
```

## Customizing MaterialDayPicker for your App

You can override these colors to change how MaterialDayPicker looks. You can also update these values in your night color resources directory to update how MaterialDayPicker looks in dark mode:

```xml
<color name="dayPressed">@color/colorPrimaryDark</color>
<color name="daySelected">@color/colorPrimary</color>
<color name="daySelectedTextColor">@android:color/white</color>
<color name="dayDeselected">#FAFAFA</color>
<color name="dayDeselectedTextColor">@android:color/black</color>

<!-- Customizing colors for disabled days-->
<color name="daySelectedAndDisabled">#43444F</color>
<color name="daySelectedAndDisabledTextColor">@color/daySelectedTextColor</color>
<color name="dayDeselectedAndDisabled">@color/dayDeselected</color>
<color name="dayDeselectedAndDisabledTextColor">@android:color/darker_gray</color>
```

If you don't want to use the device's current locale you can override it by doing:

```kotlin
materialDayPicker.locale = Locale.ENGLISH // or any other locale
```

If you want to specify the first day of the week explicitly:

```kotlin
materialDayPicker.firstDayOfWeek = MaterialDayPicker.Weekday.MONDAY // or any other day
```
